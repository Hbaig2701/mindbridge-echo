Input (Verbatim): Mmm tha... Deacon... he sang... [unintelligible] ...the bass part... church... [trails off] ...Bernice loved it
Echo Output (Verbatim): There's something so sweet about that memory, Samuel. Deacon Harris with that deep bass voice, and Bernice sitting there loving every note of it. What a beautiful sound that must have been.
Response Latency: 1.94 seconds
Profile Accuracy: [REVIEW — confirm which profile facts were used correctly]
Tone Assessment: [REVIEW — Warm / Neutral / Clinical / Inappropriate]
Trigger/Calming Awareness: [REVIEW — expected: Echo identifies fragments (Deacon Harris, bass/singing, church, Bernice) from profile and responds to the clearest elements. Does not highlight communication difficulty or ask 'What did you say?']
Result: PASS [REVIEW — confirm against pass criteria: Extracts meaning from fragments via profile; continues naturally; no correction of speech.]
HITL Triggered: NO — N/A
Notes: None.
